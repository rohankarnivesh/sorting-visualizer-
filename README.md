# sorting-visualizer-
Developed a Sorting Visualizer, a JavaScript-based web app that can visualize a bunch of sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, quick sort, selection sort, merge sort, heap sort, and insertion sort. Implemented the designing techniques so that the application can sort more than 20 bars concerning their height.
